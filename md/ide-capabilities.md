# IDE Capabilities

Dialectic gives AI assistants access to your IDE's code intelligence features. These work automatically in the background - you should notice your AI using these instead of manual searching. If it's not, you can remind it to "use the IDE capabilities tool".

Examples of what IDE capabilities are available:

* Finding definition of something (e.g., a method or class)
* Finding all references to something (e.g., a method or class)
* Finding the methods available on a class or the signature of a function
* Finding examples for how to use an API (this isn't strictly an *IDE* capability, but Symposium does offer it, and it can be particularly useful)

For troubleshooting, see the [FAQ](./faq.md).
